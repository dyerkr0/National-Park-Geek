# National-Park-Geek
A National Parks webpage made with Java Spring MVC, JDBC through Tech Elevator pair programming mini capstone project.

This site dynamically generates pages which output weather for specific parks and poll results depending on user input.

This was achieved through Java Server Pages (JSTL) and a model utilizing a PostgreSQL database which stored park, weather and survey information.

Database actions were done through a DAO interface, so this website could be easily retooled to take input from any number of sources.
